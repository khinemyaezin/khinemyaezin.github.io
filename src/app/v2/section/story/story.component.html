                Back in <strong>2013</strong>, I accidentally try my hand at building an HTML block inspired
                by my sister's
                final
                year project, and I tumbled headfirst into the rabbit hole of coding.

                Fast forward to recently,
                and I’ve had the privilege of building custom software for a finance company.
                Currently, I'm focusing on <strong>Web development</strong>.

                When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually drawing, hanging out with my friends chilling at
                the park.
